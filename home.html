                Until April of 2020, I didn't really have much knowledge of coding, but it always seemed intriguing. I was at a point where I felt I was basically treading water in 
                my career and I wanted more. There were a couple different paths I had in mind at this point. I was even considering going to aviation school to hopefully one day 
                become a pilot. I saw programming as a much more practical option that had plenty more upsides compared to other possible opportunities. I would have the chance to 
                utilize my creativity and set myself up for a career that had a positive outlook as far as longevity and income were concerned.

                I decided to attend Grand Circus' C# .Net After-Hours Bootcamp that would started April '20. Originally, I signed up for an in-person class, but COVID-19 suddently 
                took over the world. The class ended up being fully remote. I spent a lot of time in my basement that summer. It opened my eyes up to a whole new world of 
                possibilities! I still loved working at QL, and didn't really have a desire to leave the company. I did interview a couple of times internally, but the desired 
                outcome of landing a job internally in tech at QL was never realized. However, I was aware that QL offered a training program to team members outside of tech
                to learn how to program and hopefully one day become a software engineer internally. This was actually a big reason why I decided to sign up for the bootcamp at Grand 
                Circus. Knowing that if everything didn't work out with finding a job, I had a chance to get into Dev.Build if I had shown a passion and a desire to become a software 
                engineer through past experiences.

            <p>
                Now that I'm in Dev.Build and have been programming for about a year, I can see myself creating an exciting career here at QL upon graduation. I really enjoy 
                working with data. SQL was probably my favorite part of the Grand Circus class I started back in 2020. Really though, I'm just trying to learn as much as I can 
                across all languages, as I know it will make me a better developer in the end. A few years down the line, I think I could see myself in some type of visionary role, 
                maybe a scrum master! Even a Team Leader or Product Owner would be cool, but that would take me away from the programming aspect a bit.
